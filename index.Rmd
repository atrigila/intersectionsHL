## Introduction

In this notebook, I will add two approaches to intersect accelerated elements (ARs) to HL genes. Using a previous approach, we showed that the proportion of noncoding regions acting on HL was higher than the proportion of coding regions. In that initial approach, we used information from each gene's intronic region to subset the number of ARs that overlapped each gene. As per reviewer's suggest, a substantial number of potential regulatory accelerated elements located outside the gene's body could be incorporated.

To accurately determine which potential AR could regulate a HL gene, some extra information about chromatin conformation (such as 4C or Hi-C) should be included. This data is unfortunately inexistent for the inner ear. Therefore, we can think of two approximations that could be more inclusive to try to solve this point:
1) We could use chromatin conformation data from other tissues, since it was shown that since the genome is organized into hierarchical 3D structures, such as topologically associated domains (TADs),  that  are  thought  to  bring distal  regulatory  elements  in  close  proximity  to  the  target promoter.
2) We could define a gene regulatory domain definition, such as that applied in GREAT and other studies (Roscito et al. 2019): Each gene is assigned a basal regulatory domain of a minimum distance upstream and downstream of the TSS (regardless of other nearby genes). The gene regulatory domain is extended in both directions to the nearest gene's basal domain but no more than the maximum extension in one direction.

Using these two approximations, we will calculate if the proportion of noncoding (potentially regulatory) accelerated elements (ARs) is higher than the proportion of changes in coding regions.
